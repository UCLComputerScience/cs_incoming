# The power of visualising data
This Jupyter notebook provides a self-study introduction to visualising data. It has been created for the induction programme for new undergraduate computer science students at UCL. Its purpose is to give you some insight into one of the many ways that the skills you will learn on your undergraduate course can be used in 'real life'.

## Getting started
The notebook is hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud service at:

[https://notebooks.azure.com/snicholson/projects/ucl-computer-science-data-scie](https://notebooks.azure.com/snicholson/projects/ucl-computer-science-data-scie)

To use the notebook interactively and save your changes you will need to create an account on [https://notebooks.azure.com](https://notebooks.azure.com). If you do not want to create an account then you can access the notebook using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) by clicking on this URL, you will not be able to save any changes you make using this method.
