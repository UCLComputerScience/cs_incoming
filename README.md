# The power of visualising data
This project provides a self-study introduction to visualising data. It has been created for the induction programme for new undergraduate computer science students at UCL. Its purpose is to give you some insight into one of the many ways that the skills you will learn on your undergraduate course can be used in 'real' life.

## Getting started
This project uses a cloud service Jupyter notebook. When you open one of the following links, the cloud service creates a virtual coding environment in the cloud for you to use so you don't need to install anything on your machine. It will take a few minutes for this 'environment' to be created, once it is ready you will see a page that looks a little like this one.

Once you have the notebook open using one of the following methods, you should follow the instructions in the notebook itself.

### 1. Using the notebook in the Binder cloud service (no account required, no ability to save changes)
If you do not want to create an account then you can access the notebook using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) at [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nicholsons/cs_incoming_datavis.git/master?filepath=incoming_students_data_visualisation.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nicholsons/cs_incoming_datavis.git/master?filepath=incoming_students_data_visualisation.ipynb). You will not be able to save any changes you make using this method.

### 2. Using the notebook in the Microsoft Azure Notebook cloud service (free account required, ability to save changes)
To use the notebook interactively and save your changes create an account on [https://notebooks.azure.com](https://notebooks.azure.com). 

Access the notebook hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud service at:
[https://notebooks.azure.com/snicholson/projects/ucl-computer-science-data-scie](https://notebooks.azure.com/snicholson/projects/ucl-computer-science-data-scie)

First you should 'clone' the notebook. To do this, after clicking the aboce link, click on the link to the notebook ('incoming_students_data_visualisation.ipynb'). You should see a button in the top left corner of the screen with the word 'clone'. Press this to create a copy (if you are not already logged in to Microsoft Azure Notebooks and you didn't already create an account you will be prompted to create an account now). You may need to wait a few minutes during which a copy of the notebook is made and the 'environment' is created for you.

The introductory video in the notebook is a TED talk given by Hans Rosling called ['The best stats you have ever seen'](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare).

The code examples in the notebook make use of the [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) library. This library provides direct access to the Gapminder data set. There are also examples for the use of the Gapminder data in their help and documentation.

The Gapminder data can also be accessed freely at [Gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). The 'math_achievement_8th_grade.csv' file in this repository was downloaded from Gapminder.
